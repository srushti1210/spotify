- 1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams/
SELECT track FROM spotify WHERE stream> 1000000000;

- 2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist FROM spotify ;

- 3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
SELECT SUM(comments) as total_comments FROM spotify WHERE licensed=TRUE;

- 4. Find all the tracks that belong to the album type single
SELECT * FROM spotify WHERE album_type like 'single';

- 5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
SELECT artist, COUNT(track) as count_of_tracks FROM spotify GROUP BY artist;

- 6. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.

SELECT album, AVG(danceability) as avg_danceability FROM spotify 
GROUP BY 1;

-7. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values
SELECT track,MAX(eneargy) FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 5; 

- 8. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video =  TRUE
SELECT track,
SUM(views) as total_views,
SUM(likes) as total_likes
FROM spotify
WHERE official_video =  TRUE 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
 
- 9. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
SELECT album, track, SUM(views) FROM spotify
GROUP BY album,track
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

- 10. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on spotify more than YouTube.
SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT track, 
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on='Youtube' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_youtube,
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on='Spotify' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1) as t1

-11. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
WITH ranking_artist
as
(SELECT  artist,
track,
SUM(views) as total_views,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) as rank
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,3 DESC)
SELECT * FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rank <=3 ;

- 12. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
SELECT track, artist, liveness FROM spotify 
WHERE liveness >(SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);

- 13. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album
WITH cte as
(SELECT 
album,
MAX(eneargy) as highest_energy,
MIN(eneargy) as lowest_energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1 )

SELECT album, highest_energy- lowest_energy as energy_diff
FROM cte 
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

- 14. Find tracks where eneargy -to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2
SELECT track, artist, energy, liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE (energy / liveness) > 1.2;

- 15.Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
SELECT 
   track,
   artist,
   views,
   likes,
   SUM(likes) OVER (ORDER BY views) AS cumulative_likes
FROM spotify
ORDER BY views;
